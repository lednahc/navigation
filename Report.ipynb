    "### DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "-> DQN algorithm due to discreet actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> For implementation, I took help of the sample code provided by Udacity for this assignment and OpenAI baselines.\n",

    "\n",
    "-> Used Adam optim with learning rate of 5e-4. \n",

    "\n",
    "Following hyperparameters have been used to train the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)  # replay buffer size\n",
    "- BATCH_SIZE = 64         # minibatch size\n",
    "- GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor\n",
    "- TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters\n",
    "- LR = 5e-4               # learning rate \n",
    "- UPDATE_EVERY = 4        # how often to update the network\n",

    "\n",
    "### Network architecture\n",
    "The network consists of two hidden layers\n",
    "* First hidden layer contains 64 nodes.\n",
    "* Second hidden layer contains 64 nodes.\n",
    "* Relu activation is applied on both the layers.\n",
